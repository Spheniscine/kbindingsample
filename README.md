# KBinding Sample

A sample app demonstrating the KBinding library (pre-alpha development).

Currently has one screen, which demonstrates using KBinding together with Anko Layouts for an MVVM architecture. The screen itself allows the user select a country using a third-party [CountryCodePicker](https://github.com/joielechong/CountryCodePicker) (hence demostrating definition of custom bindings) and enter in a phone number. This can then be "translated" back and forth to the E164 international phone format.
